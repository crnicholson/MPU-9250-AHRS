MPU-9250-AHRS

This repository was created to address significant shortcomings in other AHRS repositories for the MPU-9250 9DOF sensor.  

The currently implemented AHRS algorithm is the standard Madgwick/Mahoney scheme (two alternative solvers) found in 
other repositories. However, new features have been added, such as code to simplify accurate calibration of the accelerometer, 
magnetometer and gyro. Care was taken to correctly align the magnetometer and accelerometer axes, so that the output orientation
is meaningful, and to simplify overall operation. 

SENSOR CALIBRATION
The magnetometer and accelerometer calibration approaches are described in this excellent blog article:

The author describes magneto, a fair sized C program that runs on a PC or a Mac (suggest to use Code::Blocks IDE on Windows). 
For convenience, Iâ€™ve collected all of the basic parts of magneto, described in the sailboatinstruments link, into one file 
that can be compiled and run on a desktop.
The magneto approach fits an ellipsoid to the data, avoiding statistical problems associated with the min/max approach, 
rotates the ellipsoid to align with the coordinate axes, scales the axial dimensions to a sphere, and rotates back. 
The result is a set of offsets and a nine element matrix correction that must be applied to the raw data.

The magneto program was modified to add measurement rejection criteria and to publish data initialization statements 
that can be incorporated directly into the AHRS code.
