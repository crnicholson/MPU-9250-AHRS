Basic setup: 8MHz/3.3V Arduino Pro Mini with direct I2C connection to MPU-9250 module (e.g. Sparkfun)

1. Run MPU9250_cal and follow instructions. 
   First, the gyro offsets are collected and averaged. Keep sensor still!
   Second, 300 raw data points are collected for accelerometer x,y,z and magnetometer x,y,z
   When done, copy the screen from the serial monitor, and use a spreadsheet to create six columns of data.
   Save as .csv file (Comma Separated Value (either space, tab or comma separation is OK).
   
2. Split apart the above .csv file to make two separate files for the magnetometer and accelerometer, each with three columns.

3. Run Magneto v1.3 twice, once for each sensor.  
   For the accelerometer, Hnorm=10000. is a suitable choice. 
   For the magnetometer, Hnorm = 100. is a suitable choice. Remeber these choices of Hnorm!
   If necessary, reject measurements that deviate by more than 2*sigma from the mean (rejection n = 2.0)
   
4. Copy the output of Magneto into either MPU9520_tiltcomp or MPU9250_AHRS. At the moment the program is set up to use
   only the offset (B) and the diagonal elements of the matrix Ainv, which must be divided by the Hnorm values. This is to scale the 
   measurement vectors lengths to 1.0 on average. See the example code for typical values
   
5. For the AHRS, copy the gyro offsets from the original run of MPU9250_cal into the G_off[] initialization statements.
